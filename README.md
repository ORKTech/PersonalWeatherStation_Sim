# PersonalWeatherStation_Sim
🌦️ Personal Weather Station Simulator

A project developed by Team Nano Bugs at the Elenxia Hackathon (MIT-WPU) under the theme IoT & Embedded Systems – Connecting Worlds.

This simulator mimics a personal weather station by generating random temperature and humidity data, displaying live readings on a clean interface, and triggering alerts when conditions go beyond the “comfortable” range (e.g., temperature above 30°C).
